# Low Code/No Code: the TL;DR 

## What is it?

Low Code/No code refers to platforms that allow you to build software, perform analytics and build data science pipelines with little or no coding.

## So what?

It's interesting to experiment with low code/no code platforms so...

* ...you can visualise pipelines, easily prototyping work early and effectively 
* ...its easier to share with non-technical experts - avoid "lost in translation" with developers  
* ...its a lower bar to entry for non-technical experts to experiment with data science 

## Libraries 

This tutorial experiments with KNIME, 

You will need to [download the tool](https://www.knime.com/downloads/download-knime) for your respective OSs. 

To follow the demo, you'll need to install some basic 'extensions' we will need for our interactive demo. You can do that by going to File (left top corner) -> Install extensions -> to start with choose "KNIME & Extensions", "KNIME Labs", "KNIME Community Contributions - Other"
