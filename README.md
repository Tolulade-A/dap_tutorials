# Tutorials @ Nesta ‚ú® 

**A one-stop shop for data analytics tutorials given @ Nesta üõçÔ∏è**

This repository is to store code for tutorials given @ Nesta. The tutorials are largely from our have-a-go series, a monthly session on a new tool/feature, led by those in the data analytics practice. 

## have-a-go purpose üõéÔ∏è 

**What‚Äôs the problem:** DS methods & tools often contain small hurdles to getting started‚Ä¶and documentation is not always great. 

have-a-go has started as an *informal* 45 minute session, once a month on a method / tool / feature / best-practice that a team member (or 2!) has recently learned.

The crucial element of the session is that everyone has a chance to **have-a-go** during the session, in the way of exercises or break out rooms.   

## have-a-go process üß∞

So you've decided to have-a-go! The process is a 6 step-er:

1. Decide on what you're keen to learn. Take a look at the existing tutorials to get some inspiration on what's out there. 
2. [Sign up for a session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XoNQ9gSZ0xi8KM1DQVYtGe874cDet4iHUcU0w6wCvTI/edit?usp=gmail_thread) to recap on what you've learnt.   
3. Add code and a high level tl;dr README.md in its own directory in this repo. You can simply name the directory the tool / method you learned. You do NOT need to create a powerpoint for the session, the most important element is exercises/questions that everyone can try to answer in the session. 
4. Slack any set up instructions _in advance (2-3 days)_ to the #ds-team channel
5. Demo away! You'll know the session is a success if people have a change to use the tool.  
6. Once you've done your have-a-go session, please @ the next person in the have-a-go sign up sheet as a reminder.  

## to code review or not? ü§î 

Tag someone in a minimal PR to **make sure the code runs** before your demo.
