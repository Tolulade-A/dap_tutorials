## Tutorials

As part of the #have-a-go series for our ds-meetings, we are demoing tools and libraries that people are keen to learn. We've created issues under the tag #have-a-go tag for all the tools and libraries people expressed interest in during the 30/06 DS team meeting. If you'd like to create a new issue for a tool you're keen to get a demo on, feel free to create one in this repo.

We'd like to keep track of tool tutorials in a single place so if someone can't make a session, they can still complete a demo. Simply add your tutorial to this directory. When you've added it, make sure to update the directory below. Feel free to add a section if you need to.

Happy tutorial-ing!
